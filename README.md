single layer menu for arduino with 2 push button(yes and no).
Connect 2 buttons to A0 pin and use "analogRead(pin)" to detect which one pushed.
If No button pushed change item selection.
and if yes button pushed it will show a print for example.

Also don't used lcd.clear() function because it will cleared LCD periodly(according to delay time) and I didn't like it:)

"Good Luck"
